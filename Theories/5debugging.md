    1) Using LOG:-
        It is used to display system messages, such as when a garbage collection occurs and messages that you add to your app with the log access.
        It displays messages in real time and keeps a history so you can view older messages.

    2) Using LogCat :-
        Same is log just difference is that logat alwyas check the LOGS property that it is true or false before logging any message.
        Which can be set to true in the debug build type and to false in the release type.
        
    3) Using Debug Mode :-
        After executing the app we can debug the application..

    4) Using Break Points :-
        When you are at a point where you can't fix the bug just by looking at your code it's time to use breakpoints.
        Breakpoints allow you to pause the execution of your app at a particular line of code.
    
    5) Using Toast.
        To test as well notify to user as well.
