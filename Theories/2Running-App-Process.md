#  ADB AND AVD 
    => These are used to debug the application on run time.
    => ADB :- Android debug bridge. (Runs on Real/virtual device)
    => AVD :- Android virtual device.

    AVD (Android Virtual Device) and ADB (Android Debug Bridge) are tools used in Android development, each serving different purposes:
    AVD (Android Virtual Device):
            AVD refers to a configuration that allows developers to emulate an Android device on their computer using the Android Emulator.
            It is part of Android Studio, enabling testing and debugging of Android applications without needing a physical device.
            Developers can specify various parameters for an AVD, such as:
            Screen size and resolution.
            Android version (API level).
            Hardware features (e.g., RAM, storage, GPU).
        Example Use:
        To test how an app behaves on different screen sizes or Android versions.

    ADB (Android Debug Bridge):
        ADB is a command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with Android devices (real or virtual) from their computer.
            It acts as a bridge between a development machine and an Android device/emulator.
            Functions include:
            Installing/uninstalling apps.
            Accessing device logs.
            Debugging apps.
        Transferring files between the development machine and the device.
        # Common ADB Commands:
            adb devices - Lists connected devices/emulators.
            adb install app.apk - Installs an APK file on the connected device.
            adb logcat - Shows the device's log messages.
            adb shell - Opens a shell on the connected device for advanced debugging or configuration.
            Both tools are essential for Android developers to streamline the development and testing process.

            adb devices
            Lists all connected devices or emulators.
            Output includes the device ID and status (e.g., device, offline, or unauthorized).
            adb version

            Displays the version of ADB installed.
            adb help

            Shows help information about ADB commands.
            
            App Management
            adb install <path/to/app.apk>

            Installs an APK file on the connected device.
            Add the -r flag to reinstall without uninstalling the app:
            adb install -r app.apk
            adb uninstall <package_name>

            Uninstalls an app from the device.
            adb shell pm list packages

            Lists all installed packages on the device.
            Add filters:
            -3: Third-party apps.
            -s: System apps.
            adb shell am start -n <package_name>/<activity_name>

            Launches an app/activity.
            File Operations
            adb push <local_path> <remote_path>

            Copies a file from the computer to the device.
            Example: adb push myfile.txt /sdcard/
            adb pull <remote_path> <local_path>

            Copies a file from the device to the computer.
            Example: adb pull /sdcard/myfile.txt ./
            adb shell ls <path>

            Lists files and directories in the specified path on the device.
            Debugging and Logs
            adb logcat

            Streams the device's log output.
            Add filters, such as adb logcat *:E (only errors).
            adb shell dumpsys

            Provides system diagnostics and information.
            adb bugreport <output_file>
