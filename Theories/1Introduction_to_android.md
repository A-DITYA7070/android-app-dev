**Introduction to Android.**
    # Android is an open source linux based operating system.
    # User -> Apps -> OS -> Hardware.
    # An OS is a software prog that enables the hardware to communicate and operate with the software.
    # OS is an interface between user and hardware.
    # os provides s/w platform on top of which other programs called application programs can run.


**Static and Dynamic Apps:-**
    => Static apps are not reliant on internet connection to an online server or db.
    => Apps built in this way are downloaded once,usually periodically updated.
    => Are able to function offline only with the device on which they are installed.
        Ex :- Calculator,Calender etc.

    => Dynamic apps are in some way reliant on an online server or database.
    => When connected these apps retrieve data updates from a main server.
    => So that any iterative changes to development, design, functionality are rolled out across all devices simultaneously.
        Ex :- Facebook,Insta,Whatsapp etc.
